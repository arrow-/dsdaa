Stupid, yet common mysteries demystefied
========================================

Does ``python`` have access specifiers?
----------------------------------------

Short Answer: *No, it does not*. The top answer on StackOverflow_ is perfect. The philosophy behind access specifiers is,
	
	*It's not about forbidding access or hiding something, it's about implicit API documentation. Developers as well as compilers/interpreter/code-checker easily see which members are recommended to be used and which ones shouldn't get touched (or at least with care). In most cases it would be a horrible mess if all members of a class or module were public. Consider the distinction of private/protected/public members as a service, saying: "Hey, these members are important while those are used internally and probably not useful for you."*

	â€“ Oben Sonne

Then why is the book littered with class names, method names that start with ``_<name>``?

That's a convention followed by all Python Developers, and you should (understand and) follow it too. How is this convention *useful* and who *implements* it? As noted above, most IDEs and other dev-services understand this convention.

The proof_ shows you the configuration of a docstring_ parser called **Napolean**. **Napolean** is used by Sphinx_, an automated documentation generator. You can see that the parser can be told not to ``auto-document`` the *"private"* functions, methods and attributes.

What is ``self``? Is it same as ``this->``?
